"""4. Closure
A Closure is a function object that remembers values in enclosing scopes even if they are not present in memory. We have a closure in Python when a nested function 
references a value in its enclosing scope.
a. Study the following program by executing it:
def multiplier_of(n):
def multiplier(number):
return number*n
return multiplier
multiplywith5 = multiplier_of(5)
print(multiplywith5(9))
b. In a lottery system, random number is chosen by retrieving the number from a random
index from a list of random numbers. Write a program to choose a random number in this
way. You must use nested functions â€“ the inner function chooses a number from a random
index and the outer function generates a random list of numbers. The outer function takes
n as a parameter where is the maximum number that can be put in the random list.
